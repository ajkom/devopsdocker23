I used render.com. It has a native support for Docker, so I didn't need to configure anything else.
I created an acc and connected my GitHub account. For the purposes of this task I used a very old and simple
website that I created years ago for a school course. I researched how to run html in Docker and used httpd in Dockerfile.

On render.com I chose "static site" and simply selected the repository and followed the instructions which were pretty straightforward.
